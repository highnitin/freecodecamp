Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
- nounce: a number used once to fint the solution to the blockchain problem
It is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address
- private key
- elliptci curve digital signature algorithm
- public key
- signing a transaction
- private key > public key > address

Each different blockchain have slightly different algorithm and slightly different metrics or criteria to do stuff. However, the concepts will be same. 

Node - A single instance in a descentralized network/

Blockchains are resilient

Blockchain nodes keep list of the transactions that orrurs

- Consensus, proof of work, proof of stake

Consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain

Roughly consensus can be broken down into

1. Chain Selection
2. Sybil Resistance

- Pow
- PoS

- Nakamoto Consensus

- Block Confirmations

Proof of Work uses a lot of energy

Gas fee is paid by the person who does transactions

- Sybil Attack
- 51% Attack

- Longest Chain Rule

- Proof of stake node put up collateral as a sybit resistance mechanism

- Miners are called validatos

- Ramdonness

PoS uses much less energy

- Scalability

- Sharding

- Layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation

- Layer 2: Any application build on top of a layer 2

- Rollups
