What is blockchain?

Read about bitcoin whitepaper

Ethereum protocol and bitcoin protocol

What is the Oracle problem?

Blockchain Oracle

Hybrid Smart contract?
on chain + off chain agreement

Chainlink - decentralized oracle network

Smart contract platform <> blockchain

Dapp = decentralized application = decentralized protocol = smart contract

What is the value of smart contracts?
- unbreakable promises, agreements

The purpose of smart contract
- it is more like pinky swear
- example of Mac D of $1 million lottery

What is a smart contract?
- A smart contract is an agreement, contract or a set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain.

Once deployed
- cannot be altered (immutable)
- automatically executes
- everyone sees the terms of the agreement

Smary contract balue = trust minimized agreements

Many node operators run blockchains

Other features smart contract have
- Decentralized
- Transparency and flexibility
- Speed and efficiency
- Security and immutability
- counterparty risk removal
- trust minimized agreements

What have smart contracts done so far?

Defi - decentralized finance
DAOs - decentralized autonomous organizations
NFTs - non fungible tokens

Genesis Blokc -
- the first block in a blockchain

- Hash, hash algorith
- Block: a list of transactions mined together 
- Mining: the process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem.
In our example, the problem was to fina a hash that starts with four zeros.
Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
