What is blockchain?

Read about bitcoin whitepaper

Ethereum protocol and bitcoin protocol

What is the Oracle problem?

Blockchain Oracle

Hybrid Smart contract?
on chain + off chain agreement

Chainlink - decentralized oracle network

Smart contract platform <> blockchain

Dapp = decentralized application = decentralized protocol = smart contract

What is the value of smart contracts?
- unbreakable promises, agreements

The purpose of smart contract
- it is more like pinky swear
- example of Mac D of $1 million lottery

What is a smart contract?
- A smart contract is an agreement, contract or a set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain.

Once deployed
- cannot be altered (immutable)
- automatically executes
- everyone sees the terms of the agreement

Smary contract balue = trust minimized agreements

Many node operators run blockchains

Other features smart contract have
- Decentralized
- Transparency and flexibility
- Speed and efficiency
- Security and immutability
- counterparty risk removal
- trust minimized agreements

What have smart contracts done so far?

Defi - decentralized finance
DAOs - decentralized autonomous organizations
NFTs - non fungible tokens

Understandin Gas

- Who are miners or validators

- Gas is a unit of computational measure. the more complex your transaction is the more gas you have to pay.

- any transaction on the blockchain comes with paying gas

What is hash?
A unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. they are created by placing said data into a hash function.

Genesis Blokc -
- the first block in a blockchain

- Hash, hash algorith
- Block: a list of transactions mined together 
- Mining: the process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem.
In our example, the problem was to fina a hash that starts with four zeros.
Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
- nounce: a number used once to fint the solution to the blockchain problem
It is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address
- private key
- elliptci curve digital signature algorithm
- public key
- signing a transaction
- private key > public key > address

Each different blockchain have slightly different algorithm and slightly different metrics or criteria to do stuff. However, the concepts will be same. 

Node - A single instance in a descentralized network/

Blockchains are resilient

Blockchain nodes keep list of the transactions that orrurs

- Consensus, proof of work, proof of stake

Consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain

Roughly consensus can be broken down into

1. Chain Selection
2. Sybil Resistance

- Pow
- PoS

- Nakamoto Consensus

- Block Confirmations

Proof of Work uses a lot of energy

Gas fee is paid by the person who does transactions

- Sybil Attack
- 51% Attack

- Longest Chain Rule

- Proof of stake node put up collateral as a sybit resistance mechanism

- Miners are called validatos

- Ramdonness

PoS uses much less energy

- Scalability

- Sharding

- Layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation

- Layer 2: Any application build on top of a layer 2

- Rollups
